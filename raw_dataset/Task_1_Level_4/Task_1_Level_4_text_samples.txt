task_1_level_4_recorded_001.wav	I would offer to escort you, but duty takes me, at an early hour, in quite another direction.
task_1_level_4_recorded_002.wav	Yet it appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make that venial.
task_1_level_4_recorded_003.wav	The young man was amused, and the dog also seemed to enjoy the exercise.
task_1_level_4_recorded_004.wav	He fairly glittered in the gloom.
task_1_level_4_recorded_005.wav	Ah, the world is too much for us.
task_1_level_4_recorded_006.wav	When he thanked her she started to her feet.
task_1_level_4_recorded_007.wav	No doubt she had bought that lot very cheap and it did not look at all inviting.
task_1_level_4_recorded_008.wav	They came round the bend together, and out into the clearing.
task_1_level_4_recorded_009.wav	I had so feared you might think it useless or foolish.
task_1_level_4_recorded_010.wav	And now let me ask you a few questions.
task_1_level_4_recorded_011.wav	The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest.
task_1_level_4_recorded_012.wav	The moonlight on the lake is worth seeing from the terrace.
task_1_level_4_recorded_013.wav	Yes, it was always this colour.
task_1_level_4_recorded_014.wav	It hops about upon the ground, chirping anxiously.
task_1_level_4_recorded_015.wav	But you will do every thing right.
task_1_level_4_recorded_016.wav	Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.
task_1_level_4_recorded_017.wav	Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
task_1_level_4_recorded_018.wav	Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow.
task_1_level_4_recorded_019.wav	I asked him how old he was.
task_1_level_4_recorded_020.wav	No sooner was it finished than it began to laugh and poke fun at him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_021.wav	He looked like a giant lizard with legs and arms.
task_1_level_4_recorded_022.wav	Good man, will you be kind enough to give a penny to a poor boy who is yawning from hunger?
task_1_level_4_recorded_023.wav	He has no income, no profession, no home all those things tell against him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_024.wav	He is a most valorous captain.
task_1_level_4_recorded_025.wav	Somewhere in a window a caged bird was singing its heart out to the sky.
task_1_level_4_recorded_026.wav	He will never think anything worth while.
task_1_level_4_recorded_027.wav	What have you been doing to it?
task_1_level_4_recorded_028.wav	You were most amiable to me when I first saw you.
task_1_level_4_recorded_029.wav	He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested.
task_1_level_4_recorded_030.wav	Do you fellows know who it is?
task_1_level_4_recorded_031.wav	I want to experiment on something large, he replied.
task_1_level_4_recorded_032.wav	These were horrors and no mistake.
task_1_level_4_recorded_033.wav	I have not the smallest doubt of the issue.
task_1_level_4_recorded_034.wav	I really think she has been very honest.
task_1_level_4_recorded_035.wav	Ah, what a boy he was in some ways!
task_1_level_4_recorded_036.wav	I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story.
task_1_level_4_recorded_037.wav	It was the old Italian and his daughters returning from the ball who were trying to get in.
task_1_level_4_recorded_038.wav	In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
task_1_level_4_recorded_039.wav	We shall see if you are telling the truth.
task_1_level_4_recorded_040.wav	Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.
task_1_level_4_recorded_041.wav	All eyes were turned on me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_042.wav	The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
task_1_level_4_recorded_043.wav	Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened.
task_1_level_4_recorded_044.wav	Have a good look at the thing.
task_1_level_4_recorded_045.wav	He must have stepped back a pace to hurl himself bodily against the panels.
task_1_level_4_recorded_046.wav	He had either to work or to beg.
task_1_level_4_recorded_047.wav	I could see your face, I resumed, and it seemed to me to be very sorrowful.
task_1_level_4_recorded_048.wav	Her influence would have been enough.
task_1_level_4_recorded_049.wav	This was not in the rubric, and proved disconcerting to the clergyman.
task_1_level_4_recorded_050.wav	I saw that I must act quickly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_051.wav	If it rains, what shall I do with a coat of flowered paper?
task_1_level_4_recorded_052.wav	You do, and it becomes you, she retorted with a faint smile.
task_1_level_4_recorded_053.wav	But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
task_1_level_4_recorded_054.wav	I was carried away in London!
task_1_level_4_recorded_055.wav	Then go in for other big things in America.
task_1_level_4_recorded_056.wav	I have no doubt it worked.
task_1_level_4_recorded_057.wav	What do you mean by all the rest?
task_1_level_4_recorded_058.wav	I reasoned, save the mark, as a psychologist.
task_1_level_4_recorded_059.wav	When he faced the world he also masked it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_060.wav	You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story!
task_1_level_4_recorded_061.wav	He felt he was on the right tack.
task_1_level_4_recorded_062.wav	Everything is permitted you and every one makes allowance, but every one cannot be a victim to caprice.
task_1_level_4_recorded_063.wav	He had his moustaches so, and his teeth were very white when he smiled at her.
task_1_level_4_recorded_064.wav	Did it come down from Heaven?
task_1_level_4_recorded_065.wav	There is the danger of her own self, poor girl.
task_1_level_4_recorded_066.wav	All this she told me with a sweet seriousness seldom seen in any one but children.
task_1_level_4_recorded_067.wav	How did she come to slip this bit of silk and silver about your neck?
task_1_level_4_recorded_068.wav	Here, take them, little Snail, and give them to my good Fairy.
task_1_level_4_recorded_069.wav	This concert is arranged for the amusement of her house party, and for the gratification and glorification of local celebrities.
task_1_level_4_recorded_070.wav	A fireplace full of burning logs was painted on the wall opposite the door.
task_1_level_4_recorded_071.wav	She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out.
task_1_level_4_recorded_072.wav	I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.
task_1_level_4_recorded_073.wav	He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
task_1_level_4_recorded_074.wav	a man does not imagine any such thing.
task_1_level_4_recorded_075.wav	I hear light footsteps behind closed doors...
task_1_level_4_recorded_076.wav	It was manifest to me that his soul was absent in some hell of its own.
task_1_level_4_recorded_077.wav	The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a few difficulties.
task_1_level_4_recorded_078.wav	He dreamed he was in the middle of a field.
task_1_level_4_recorded_079.wav	But is it really true that in that country boys never have to study?
task_1_level_4_recorded_080.wav	If she had steeled herself against the possibility of his shaking her, she failed herself now.
task_1_level_4_recorded_081.wav	What was I in comparison with the Principle of Legitimacy?
task_1_level_4_recorded_082.wav	I winced at my mistake, which I attenuated as I could, and opened my letter again to repeat it to her then, faltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back in my pocket.
task_1_level_4_recorded_083.wav	I must have known that there were admirers!
task_1_level_4_recorded_084.wav	Neither man nor woman has been created to live alone....
task_1_level_4_recorded_085.wav	I come in for a pretty good share as a second.
task_1_level_4_recorded_086.wav	You want to go to your uncle?
task_1_level_4_recorded_087.wav	It stretched and stretched and stretched till it became so long, it seemed endless.
task_1_level_4_recorded_088.wav	He cried, Halt, or I fire!
task_1_level_4_recorded_089.wav	I shall be eighteen in February, you know, and we want to go round the world.
task_1_level_4_recorded_090.wav	I say, Brand, I do think it is extraordinarily good of you to come all this way to see me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_091.wav	And he drew back his foot to give the Dog a kick.
task_1_level_4_recorded_092.wav	I suppose they are no more friends to you than they are to me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_093.wav	I was facing the door, and saw it first.
task_1_level_4_recorded_094.wav	White lines had drawn themselves about his tightly closed lips, yet he was smiling.
task_1_level_4_recorded_095.wav	But there had not been time for him to return, and if he had returned, I must have seen him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_096.wav	The style of the letter was much above her expectation.
task_1_level_4_recorded_097.wav	The Phantom of the Past would go no further.
task_1_level_4_recorded_098.wav	The men piled into the car, and went off for their golf.
task_1_level_4_recorded_099.wav	She leaned her head upon her hands, and answered softly, I love you.
task_1_level_4_recorded_100.wav	It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom.
task_1_level_4_recorded_101.wav	Here, it is only on Saturdays that we have no school.
task_1_level_4_recorded_102.wav	His hands were spread over his knees and he looked perfectly insensible.
task_1_level_4_recorded_103.wav	That done, he started to bark.
task_1_level_4_recorded_104.wav	I know you for a frank and loyal gentleman...
task_1_level_4_recorded_105.wav	She had never seen anything so radiant as his face.
task_1_level_4_recorded_106.wav	I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_107.wav	Here we are, said the Fox to the Marionette.
task_1_level_4_recorded_108.wav	Along the railroad embankment across the ditch, another column moved parallel to their own.
task_1_level_4_recorded_109.wav	They are sent to school, and whether they want to or not, they must study.
task_1_level_4_recorded_110.wav	It could not be because it was untrue.
task_1_level_4_recorded_111.wav	There had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose.
task_1_level_4_recorded_112.wav	I reassured her and sent her away, saying I would look about myself.
task_1_level_4_recorded_113.wav	She pointed at the other carriage.
task_1_level_4_recorded_114.wav	The rose was big and red.
task_1_level_4_recorded_115.wav	Do you know about it, please?
task_1_level_4_recorded_116.wav	He is the best father in the world, even as I am the worst son that can be found.
task_1_level_4_recorded_117.wav	I am as empty as a dried well.
task_1_level_4_recorded_118.wav	Rubbing his hands together happily, he mumbled half to himself  This has come in the nick of time.
task_1_level_4_recorded_119.wav	We are going to see it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_120.wav	He had eaten it all during the night.
task_1_level_4_recorded_121.wav	Round about him, not a leaf stirred.
task_1_level_4_recorded_122.wav	he repeated, striking his breast with his closed fist on which the knuckles stood out very white.
task_1_level_4_recorded_123.wav	Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
task_1_level_4_recorded_124.wav	Also he waited for more, knowing it would come more easily if he waited silently.
task_1_level_4_recorded_125.wav	It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not care to explain.
task_1_level_4_recorded_126.wav	In that, however, I was wrong.
task_1_level_4_recorded_127.wav	I began, laughing, but the girl interrupted me with a frightened cry.
task_1_level_4_recorded_128.wav	And then to them, Come in, girls.
task_1_level_4_recorded_129.wav	Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?
task_1_level_4_recorded_130.wav	The story I told you was true.
task_1_level_4_recorded_131.wav	You may say anything without offence.
task_1_level_4_recorded_132.wav	It is time to hunt again.
task_1_level_4_recorded_133.wav	And if I go on studying, what will you do to me?
task_1_level_4_recorded_134.wav	And what was his grief when on looking up toward the boxes, he saw that the Fairy had disappeared!
task_1_level_4_recorded_135.wav	No one ever passes except a policeman.
task_1_level_4_recorded_136.wav	She wanted to be with me always.
task_1_level_4_recorded_137.wav	Some one overtook and passed me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_138.wav	He felt he had to make up his mind for either one thing or another.
task_1_level_4_recorded_139.wav	The unlucky Marionette, hearing this, began to cry and wail and beg.
task_1_level_4_recorded_140.wav	It had had its times of seeming frightful to her, this secret, in the troubled musings of the past year.
task_1_level_4_recorded_141.wav	The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
task_1_level_4_recorded_142.wav	I would rather not be tempted.
task_1_level_4_recorded_143.wav	It was a peaceful scene, the morning light, the bit of open country framed in steep stony slopes, a high peak or two in the distance, the thin smoke of some invisible caserios, rising straight up here and there.
task_1_level_4_recorded_144.wav	I shall have no fears for you with him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_145.wav	Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone.
task_1_level_4_recorded_146.wav	For, listen, child of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs.
task_1_level_4_recorded_147.wav	This will be enough to fetch him down here, I can assure you.
task_1_level_4_recorded_148.wav	Before you do anything else, come and see this sunset on the lake.
task_1_level_4_recorded_149.wav	Very much to the honour of both, was the handsome reply.
task_1_level_4_recorded_150.wav	You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.
task_1_level_4_recorded_151.wav	Heed the warning then, she cried, with a nervous laugh.
task_1_level_4_recorded_152.wav	The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now.
task_1_level_4_recorded_153.wav	The books he touched, the chair he had at breakfast, his young, lithe body in its golfing knickerbockers, or his sleek black head above the dull black of evening wear, haunted her oddly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_154.wav	Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
task_1_level_4_recorded_155.wav	I seized the tallow dip and sprang to the door.
task_1_level_4_recorded_156.wav	I am certain that I was not in my right mind.
task_1_level_4_recorded_157.wav	replied the Marionette, jumping to his feet.
task_1_level_4_recorded_158.wav	He was done up, finished but perhaps he did not know it himself.
task_1_level_4_recorded_159.wav	His particular trick of speaking of any third person as of a lay figure was exasperating.
task_1_level_4_recorded_160.wav	Here I am so comfortable with a fire.
task_1_level_4_recorded_161.wav	They merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration.
task_1_level_4_recorded_162.wav	Such things in general cannot be too short.
task_1_level_4_recorded_163.wav	I am telling you this because you are younger than myself.
task_1_level_4_recorded_164.wav	Two men loomed up in the twilight.
task_1_level_4_recorded_165.wav	But she said nothing aloud as they turned back into the warm house.
task_1_level_4_recorded_166.wav	Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
task_1_level_4_recorded_167.wav	She will want new gowns, want to display her new importance a little.
task_1_level_4_recorded_168.wav	It had occurred to me to make a very elaborate toilet.
task_1_level_4_recorded_169.wav	It would not have been better.
task_1_level_4_recorded_170.wav	Things must come to a crisis soon now.
task_1_level_4_recorded_171.wav	The forest was passed, and the sun slipped from behind the trees, flooding the earth again with brightness.
task_1_level_4_recorded_172.wav	My love for you told me who you were.
task_1_level_4_recorded_173.wav	He fell to the ground and, covering the cold marble with kisses, burst into bitter tears.
task_1_level_4_recorded_174.wav	Three several times, as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures.
task_1_level_4_recorded_175.wav	I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.
task_1_level_4_recorded_176.wav	He climbed down from the chair and squatting on the floor, took the creature into his arms and caressed her.
task_1_level_4_recorded_177.wav	The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!
task_1_level_4_recorded_178.wav	It had become a great thing now.
task_1_level_4_recorded_179.wav	It is a very simple story.
task_1_level_4_recorded_180.wav	It was not of this earth.
task_1_level_4_recorded_181.wav	Do you think it strange that she objected?
task_1_level_4_recorded_182.wav	Well, he worked and I watched him in silence, and we went on that way until nearly midnight.
task_1_level_4_recorded_183.wav	I gave a cry of surprise.
task_1_level_4_recorded_184.wav	The duchess preferred managing her own parties in her oven way.
task_1_level_4_recorded_185.wav	I took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised.
task_1_level_4_recorded_186.wav	His pursuers were after him at once, like two dogs chasing a hare.
task_1_level_4_recorded_187.wav	I could only paint her with closed eyes, for in dreams alone can such colours as I need be found.
task_1_level_4_recorded_188.wav	Get off with his sister as soon as possible and leave me with him alone.
task_1_level_4_recorded_189.wav	I must speak to the priest about this.
task_1_level_4_recorded_190.wav	Beautiful and cruel, she repeated dreamily, beautiful and cruel.
task_1_level_4_recorded_191.wav	No, certainly not I shall go home in the cool of the evening.
task_1_level_4_recorded_192.wav	Nothing of the sort is being talked about.
task_1_level_4_recorded_193.wav	I have seen the effect in a thousand ways.
task_1_level_4_recorded_194.wav	She flattened one ear, but neither turned nor interrupted her toilet.
task_1_level_4_recorded_195.wav	I was just going to buy some clothes.
task_1_level_4_recorded_196.wav	She watched the erect, splendid old figure ascending.
task_1_level_4_recorded_197.wav	He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.
task_1_level_4_recorded_198.wav	But you are too good for that, I am sure.
task_1_level_4_recorded_199.wav	How can you do anything, unless you can spin round at once when the rein is pressed on your neck?
task_1_level_4_recorded_200.wav	From your own account, you told her as much.
task_1_level_4_recorded_201.wav	Now wash your very ungainly hands and go to bed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_202.wav	She had plenty of it, and it had a quality.
task_1_level_4_recorded_203.wav	And then far away in the distance, along the white ribbon of road, winding up from the valley, she saw a high gig, trotting swiftly one man in it, and a small groom seated behind.
task_1_level_4_recorded_204.wav	She changed her tone from sarcasm to a soft and even dreamy note.
task_1_level_4_recorded_205.wav	And when he reached the fourth line of the second verse he sang with loyal fervour.
task_1_level_4_recorded_206.wav	Plainly, this second species of Man was subterranean.
task_1_level_4_recorded_207.wav	They brought it it is mine, she sobbed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_208.wav	It was quite in another manner that I, for my part, let myself go.
task_1_level_4_recorded_209.wav	An hour passed, two hours and the door was still closed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_210.wav	She had looked extremely beautiful in that long, dark blue bedroom gown, reading Shakespeare.
task_1_level_4_recorded_211.wav	The girl walked swiftly on for a full minute.
task_1_level_4_recorded_212.wav	He looked down at the terrace.
task_1_level_4_recorded_213.wav	You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
task_1_level_4_recorded_214.wav	I think I will go to church, after all.
task_1_level_4_recorded_215.wav	I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin.
task_1_level_4_recorded_216.wav	I should have become a real boy, like all these friends of mine!
task_1_level_4_recorded_217.wav	Why do you try to look like an owl?
task_1_level_4_recorded_218.wav	Well, you had nothing to do with it!
task_1_level_4_recorded_219.wav	And this was the man to whom she had signed herself Your wife.
task_1_level_4_recorded_220.wav	Well, said he, I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_221.wav	As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart.
task_1_level_4_recorded_222.wav	I know nothing about it whatever.
task_1_level_4_recorded_223.wav	They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.
task_1_level_4_recorded_224.wav	And what is it to you, if I do study?
task_1_level_4_recorded_225.wav	And as a matter of fact I was touched.
task_1_level_4_recorded_226.wav	When morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his doings.
task_1_level_4_recorded_227.wav	The difficulty had been to obtain from him any response whatever.
task_1_level_4_recorded_228.wav	But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home.
task_1_level_4_recorded_229.wav	Go on, continue to be amusing.
task_1_level_4_recorded_230.wav	The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.
task_1_level_4_recorded_231.wav	Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations but I hope it all went off tolerably well.
task_1_level_4_recorded_232.wav	And you are going to implore him, to beg him to keep silence?
task_1_level_4_recorded_233.wav	it is good to be here!
task_1_level_4_recorded_234.wav	Two nightingales, in distant trees, sang alternately answering one another in liquid streams of melody.
task_1_level_4_recorded_235.wav	I never expected to see you again.
task_1_level_4_recorded_236.wav	While I was busy about it a bell began to ring in the distance.
task_1_level_4_recorded_237.wav	Instantly a stillness entered into her soul.
task_1_level_4_recorded_238.wav	The stores were closed, the doors, the windows.
task_1_level_4_recorded_239.wav	This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.
task_1_level_4_recorded_240.wav	If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_241.wav	She raised her hand to her cheek.
task_1_level_4_recorded_242.wav	In reward for your kind heart, I forgive you for all your old mischief.
task_1_level_4_recorded_243.wav	He was a wealthy cousin of mine.
task_1_level_4_recorded_244.wav	You must remember, my boy, answered the Pigeon, that hunger is the best sauce!
task_1_level_4_recorded_245.wav	My very admiration was making me more angry.
task_1_level_4_recorded_246.wav	Every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things.
task_1_level_4_recorded_247.wav	At this second lie, his nose grew a few more inches.
task_1_level_4_recorded_248.wav	Apparently I was not romantic enough.
task_1_level_4_recorded_249.wav	Close upon her radiant dream had come this shadow, far more a shadow now, when her responsibility had infinitely increased, and when she had had proof of the love and respect in which they held her here.
task_1_level_4_recorded_250.wav	Into the face had stolen the light that never was on sea or land.
task_1_level_4_recorded_251.wav	Then we heard the door open and shut sharply, and a swift rush in the next room.
task_1_level_4_recorded_252.wav	Also I feel like offering a reward for the discovery of that tune.
task_1_level_4_recorded_253.wav	I shall press you no more.
task_1_level_4_recorded_254.wav	Somewhere within the house a door slammed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_255.wav	Remember, Father, that I am like a cat.
task_1_level_4_recorded_256.wav	And because he is mine, my beloved is safe and because I am his, he is content.
task_1_level_4_recorded_257.wav	He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
task_1_level_4_recorded_258.wav	How could they do such a thing?
task_1_level_4_recorded_259.wav	I want to tell you about it!
task_1_level_4_recorded_260.wav	It was an island in the middle of the sea.
task_1_level_4_recorded_261.wav	He glared at me like a basilisk.
task_1_level_4_recorded_262.wav	After this discovery he was fit to face anything.
task_1_level_4_recorded_263.wav	She sat up, and put her bare feet on the floor, groping for slippers, and yawned, with a red face.
task_1_level_4_recorded_264.wav	I suppose he thought that his prey was escaping him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_265.wav	The big ravine of the Waingunga.
task_1_level_4_recorded_266.wav	That thick man, he said in a tone of perfect urbanity, is as fine as a needle.
task_1_level_4_recorded_267.wav	She had taken off her loose white coat, and pushed back the hat that pressed upon her thick, shining hair.
task_1_level_4_recorded_268.wav	If not, it will kill you in the end.
task_1_level_4_recorded_269.wav	Do not you begin to feel that now?
task_1_level_4_recorded_270.wav	Finally a little woman went by carrying two water jugs.
task_1_level_4_recorded_271.wav	She can hardly bear to speak of it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_272.wav	And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!
task_1_level_4_recorded_273.wav	She sailed out of her pew, and advanced to the chancel step.
task_1_level_4_recorded_274.wav	Yes, said his brother hesitatingly, there is a likeness.
task_1_level_4_recorded_275.wav	It does not bear talking of.
task_1_level_4_recorded_276.wav	You will feel better in the morning.
task_1_level_4_recorded_277.wav	They had long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them.
task_1_level_4_recorded_278.wav	In case you do disobey, you will be the one to suffer, not anyone else.
task_1_level_4_recorded_279.wav	They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned pillar, peering down the well.
task_1_level_4_recorded_280.wav	There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.
task_1_level_4_recorded_281.wav	It is easy to enter, but sometimes they who enter never leave it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_282.wav	Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
task_1_level_4_recorded_283.wav	Because I was all but your brother in blood, I promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as ye have betrayed me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_284.wav	I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.
task_1_level_4_recorded_285.wav	She wished him very well but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.
task_1_level_4_recorded_286.wav	I mean, would you have wished to paint her?
task_1_level_4_recorded_287.wav	In a few moments, all had disappeared.
task_1_level_4_recorded_288.wav	Ah, and how appropriate for us on this day, of all days.
task_1_level_4_recorded_289.wav	I am afraid it has been a bothersome business, he said gently.
task_1_level_4_recorded_290.wav	And thus they started down through the wood, on that lovely Sabbath morn of early summer and the doctor walked erect between those two severed hearts, uniting, and yet dividing them.
task_1_level_4_recorded_291.wav	The yoke snapped with a twang, and they lumbered off together.
task_1_level_4_recorded_292.wav	What are you mumbling to yourself?
task_1_level_4_recorded_293.wav	The feeling soon passed it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
task_1_level_4_recorded_294.wav	In one point she was fully justified.
task_1_level_4_recorded_295.wav	At midnight the wagon passes here that is to take us within the boundaries of that marvelous country.
task_1_level_4_recorded_296.wav	The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
task_1_level_4_recorded_297.wav	I could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_298.wav	Now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon.
task_1_level_4_recorded_299.wav	I merely throw it out as a suggestion.
task_1_level_4_recorded_300.wav	Take him home and bind his wounds.
task_1_level_4_recorded_301.wav	queried the strained voice from the bed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_302.wav	Some day they will lead you astray.
task_1_level_4_recorded_303.wav	Yes, I venture still to think it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_304.wav	And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is!
task_1_level_4_recorded_305.wav	asked the Marionette, who was beginning to waver and weaken in his good resolutions.
task_1_level_4_recorded_306.wav	The light at the window had nearly failed, and the girl bent low over her work.
task_1_level_4_recorded_307.wav	There was a scraping of chairs on the stone floor, and a rustling as the congregation rose.
task_1_level_4_recorded_308.wav	The minute or two gained by hurrying them is lost in the final results.
task_1_level_4_recorded_309.wav	The next morning they were at the seashore.
task_1_level_4_recorded_310.wav	She heard the door into the lower hall open and close.
task_1_level_4_recorded_311.wav	I lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.
task_1_level_4_recorded_312.wav	Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what is.
task_1_level_4_recorded_313.wav	No, it shall be of gold and silver with diamond buttons.
task_1_level_4_recorded_314.wav	As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority.
task_1_level_4_recorded_315.wav	No, I want to be really truthful.
task_1_level_4_recorded_316.wav	This thing is beyond words altogether, I said.
task_1_level_4_recorded_317.wav	Yes, I too was born among men.
task_1_level_4_recorded_318.wav	And then something happened which almost caused a riot.
task_1_level_4_recorded_319.wav	And will you let me play a few of your accompaniments?
task_1_level_4_recorded_320.wav	The doctor kicked the pine log, and the flames darted up merrily.
task_1_level_4_recorded_321.wav	I shall have to look again some other day.
task_1_level_4_recorded_322.wav	I am not certain about the stupidity.
task_1_level_4_recorded_323.wav	They have their positions, their families to go back to but we are different.
task_1_level_4_recorded_324.wav	As I had no matches on me I waited for a while in the dark.
task_1_level_4_recorded_325.wav	Two or three white peacocks picked their way across the lawns, and a drab coloured pigeon sat so motionless on the arm of one of the Fates, that it seemed to be a part of the sculptured stone.
task_1_level_4_recorded_326.wav	But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.
task_1_level_4_recorded_327.wav	I had no doubt that the man knew of her being there but he only knew it by hearsay.
task_1_level_4_recorded_328.wav	I fancy I am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown.
task_1_level_4_recorded_329.wav	I know, I know, I know!
task_1_level_4_recorded_330.wav	What are you doing stretched out on the ground?
task_1_level_4_recorded_331.wav	But I had no sooner spoken than I caught myself up.
task_1_level_4_recorded_332.wav	Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?
task_1_level_4_recorded_333.wav	My mother and my cousin have gone.
task_1_level_4_recorded_334.wav	They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.
task_1_level_4_recorded_335.wav	The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.
task_1_level_4_recorded_336.wav	I have never seen anything like that.
task_1_level_4_recorded_337.wav	said the mother, and the conversation lagged.
task_1_level_4_recorded_338.wav	But for its elasticity it might have been frozen.
task_1_level_4_recorded_339.wav	And what a horrible night it was!
task_1_level_4_recorded_340.wav	Then another sound broke upon my ears like the raising of a window sash.
task_1_level_4_recorded_341.wav	By the way, I was quite unprepared to find him such a character.
task_1_level_4_recorded_342.wav	That day she carried no barbarous arrow in her hair.
task_1_level_4_recorded_343.wav	He listened for a few moments and heard nothing.
task_1_level_4_recorded_344.wav	This was too true for contradiction.
task_1_level_4_recorded_345.wav	Did he put that to you as a justification?
task_1_level_4_recorded_346.wav	Then she took up the paper and opened it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_347.wav	Never, truly, had a person turned out shown so little to explain it as this little person!
task_1_level_4_recorded_348.wav	But they answered the call from habit and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen into, and some limped from shot wounds, and some were mangy from eating bad food, and many were missing.
task_1_level_4_recorded_349.wav	This was the man who, bowing his dark head towards the crucifixion window, said I accept the cross.
task_1_level_4_recorded_350.wav	But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_351.wav	she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.
task_1_level_4_recorded_352.wav	Well, take off the bandage and look, said the doctor.
task_1_level_4_recorded_353.wav	I caught up my coat left my hat and bag.
task_1_level_4_recorded_354.wav	Even to tears, I said provokingly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_355.wav	Do you find such sayings in your books?
task_1_level_4_recorded_356.wav	It must, if I were not here.
task_1_level_4_recorded_357.wav	She kept her eyes on me, and repeated with a sort of whimsical enviousness  The sea!
task_1_level_4_recorded_358.wav	What to my backward glance seems startling and a little awful is their punctualness and inevitability.
task_1_level_4_recorded_359.wav	Its population, large though it was, was composed wholly of boys.
task_1_level_4_recorded_360.wav	What was wrong with that silence?
task_1_level_4_recorded_361.wav	I had a bizarre notion that he was not to be disturbed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_362.wav	Are you sure we are alone?
task_1_level_4_recorded_363.wav	In that very room she had been measured last September, with her two friends.
task_1_level_4_recorded_364.wav	I do not know how long I sat peering down that well.
task_1_level_4_recorded_365.wav	You can direct me in most things, but not in this.
task_1_level_4_recorded_366.wav	They want to get to them.
task_1_level_4_recorded_367.wav	The sense of manhood and mastery the right of control, the joy of possession, arose within him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_368.wav	The hands spun backward upon the dials.
task_1_level_4_recorded_369.wav	She even answered my question quite readily with many words out of which I could make very little.
task_1_level_4_recorded_370.wav	The darkness presently fell from my eyes.
task_1_level_4_recorded_371.wav	He looked at me curiously, with that same searching glance which I hate and fear so in doctors.
task_1_level_4_recorded_372.wav	We were soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles.
task_1_level_4_recorded_373.wav	A horrid mistrust of the whole house possessed me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_374.wav	Did you really tell him to get out and never come near you again, or something awful like that?
task_1_level_4_recorded_375.wav	They were looking over views in Swisserland.
task_1_level_4_recorded_376.wav	I, too, she said with a sort of funny eagerness.
task_1_level_4_recorded_377.wav	I shall have to send to town.
task_1_level_4_recorded_378.wav	Then she asked me in her soft quaint accent how I had passed the night, and whether I was very much inconvenienced by wearing the clothes which old Pelagie had put there for me while I slept.
task_1_level_4_recorded_379.wav	Faces grew more distinct among the marching masses and he recognized one.
task_1_level_4_recorded_380.wav	He is taking his meal with the others.
task_1_level_4_recorded_381.wav	And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind by lighting it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_382.wav	Your one possible course would be to collapse into the mud, and let the ducal gouties trample on you.
task_1_level_4_recorded_383.wav	She was his object, and every body must perceive it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_384.wav	I left him three days ago on the shore of a large sea.
task_1_level_4_recorded_385.wav	He who steals grapes may very easily steal chickens also.
task_1_level_4_recorded_386.wav	A glorious September sun blazed down upon the water, there was absolute silence up and down the curving shore.
task_1_level_4_recorded_387.wav	Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
task_1_level_4_recorded_388.wav	I went back to the studio, and resumed my work.
task_1_level_4_recorded_389.wav	So you do love me, little thing?
task_1_level_4_recorded_390.wav	I went eagerly to every unbroken case.
task_1_level_4_recorded_391.wav	The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
task_1_level_4_recorded_392.wav	Heaps of people can sing a little, but very few can accompany properly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_393.wav	No.  Bribes were out of the question, he admitted.
task_1_level_4_recorded_394.wav	His long nose became at least two inches longer.
task_1_level_4_recorded_395.wav	He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
task_1_level_4_recorded_396.wav	Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had vanished.
task_1_level_4_recorded_397.wav	They were never importunate and yet never listless.
task_1_level_4_recorded_398.wav	No one has come out this way.
task_1_level_4_recorded_399.wav	I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_400.wav	However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first and I make so light of it now to her, that she does not think much about it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_401.wav	This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles.
task_1_level_4_recorded_402.wav	That part of it represented by the fabulous collections was still being protected by the police.
task_1_level_4_recorded_403.wav	I have never seen you in such a mood.
task_1_level_4_recorded_404.wav	We are waiting, was the reply.
task_1_level_4_recorded_405.wav	A cloud passed before the sun.
task_1_level_4_recorded_406.wav	I, of course, could not share his consternation.
task_1_level_4_recorded_407.wav	It is the greatest amusement in the world!
task_1_level_4_recorded_408.wav	Remember, Mother, it is always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach.
task_1_level_4_recorded_409.wav	Waiting, he replied, in accents of adoration.
task_1_level_4_recorded_410.wav	I knew that something strange had happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be.
task_1_level_4_recorded_411.wav	Well, pretty good news, is not it?
task_1_level_4_recorded_412.wav	The public pays and must be served well.
task_1_level_4_recorded_413.wav	Why yes, but he is going to have a tough time when some of his illusions are dispelled.
task_1_level_4_recorded_414.wav	Some took a nibble, some took a bite, but no sooner had they tasted a page or two, than they spat them out with a wry face, as if to say  What a horrid taste!
task_1_level_4_recorded_415.wav	I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself.
task_1_level_4_recorded_416.wav	My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so.
task_1_level_4_recorded_417.wav	Nothing can be more simple, you see.
task_1_level_4_recorded_418.wav	What I remember is that I was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of cleverness.
task_1_level_4_recorded_419.wav	It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
task_1_level_4_recorded_420.wav	Along the way he felt very uneasy.
task_1_level_4_recorded_421.wav	Fearing lest he might examine the combination I led the way into my study.
task_1_level_4_recorded_422.wav	The little woman stood a moment pensive and then sighed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_423.wav	But I shall get it out of you yet!
task_1_level_4_recorded_424.wav	What do I care when the child has nothing?
task_1_level_4_recorded_425.wav	I knew all that was taking place, as soon as I should have known it had I had my sight.
task_1_level_4_recorded_426.wav	He growled as much as a man of his accomplished manner and voice could growl.
task_1_level_4_recorded_427.wav	Ah, well, I knew of course that you would manage it!
task_1_level_4_recorded_428.wav	After some cogitation he murmured There is another way of getting the news to Headquarters.
task_1_level_4_recorded_429.wav	She should not have asked him to dinner he should not accept her invitation.
task_1_level_4_recorded_430.wav	You had much better not play.
task_1_level_4_recorded_431.wav	She does not know all our plans of cords, and notches, and things.
task_1_level_4_recorded_432.wav	It would be rather a blow to sculpture, would it not?
task_1_level_4_recorded_433.wav	Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
task_1_level_4_recorded_434.wav	I braced myself up against the moment when it would move.
task_1_level_4_recorded_435.wav	You know that all my people like you very much, though they hold various opinions as to your discretion.
task_1_level_4_recorded_436.wav	He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
task_1_level_4_recorded_437.wav	Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing you justice.
task_1_level_4_recorded_438.wav	This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time.
task_1_level_4_recorded_439.wav	It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and we are not very clever.
task_1_level_4_recorded_440.wav	Pray do not let them talk of it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_441.wav	I wore a beard out there no time to shave and my jacket proclaimed me a serjeant, not a surgeon.
task_1_level_4_recorded_442.wav	My mother has never been treated with impertinence before, and the aesthetic impression must have been of extraordinary strength.
task_1_level_4_recorded_443.wav	I would draw a long breath of relief to have it settled.
task_1_level_4_recorded_444.wav	My nervous annoyance changed to anger.
task_1_level_4_recorded_445.wav	How dare you offer me this charlatanism of passion?
task_1_level_4_recorded_446.wav	I mean your choice of words.
task_1_level_4_recorded_447.wav	Do you say these horrors to make me tremble?
task_1_level_4_recorded_448.wav	he asked, with a little husky laugh.
task_1_level_4_recorded_449.wav	You must have seen that I did.
task_1_level_4_recorded_450.wav	We had arrived within sight of the church and of various persons, including several of the household of Bly, on their way to it and clustered about the door to see us go in.
task_1_level_4_recorded_451.wav	The gentlemen spoke of his horse.
task_1_level_4_recorded_452.wav	Finally, he could control himself no longer and gave a loud sneeze.
task_1_level_4_recorded_453.wav	It was a serious matter for him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_454.wav	They were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.
task_1_level_4_recorded_455.wav	What was it that had got into that stillness?
task_1_level_4_recorded_456.wav	I wanted to know a little more, and this tells me quite enough.
task_1_level_4_recorded_457.wav	She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.
task_1_level_4_recorded_458.wav	We are confronted in this case by a psychological problem, and one which very likely has not occurred to you.
task_1_level_4_recorded_459.wav	Not a soul knows I have come home.
task_1_level_4_recorded_460.wav	The big panther turned his head away in half a minute.
task_1_level_4_recorded_461.wav	But the fault is not mine.
task_1_level_4_recorded_462.wav	In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches.
task_1_level_4_recorded_463.wav	I might run up now and see the old lady!
task_1_level_4_recorded_464.wav	Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort.
task_1_level_4_recorded_465.wav	Just so, said the other meaningly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_466.wav	Well, we must look for love affairs now!
task_1_level_4_recorded_467.wav	In the pan, instead of oil or butter, he poured a little water.
task_1_level_4_recorded_468.wav	At the same instant he plunged his hand into the basin and drew out the flower.
task_1_level_4_recorded_469.wav	His cheerful, casual manner masked no weakness, every muscle in the young, big body was hard from tennis and baseball.
task_1_level_4_recorded_470.wav	The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
task_1_level_4_recorded_471.wav	Take him to the market and sell him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_472.wav	It was rather fascinating to see him so quiet at the end of all that fury, clamour, passion, and uproar.
task_1_level_4_recorded_473.wav	Hundreds of other men were presumably buying their wives shoes, up and down the brilliant street.
task_1_level_4_recorded_474.wav	Yet they were as beautifully smooth as her voice when she admitted That protection naturally is only partial.
task_1_level_4_recorded_475.wav	And in any case, if it is written that we must die, we shall at least die together.
task_1_level_4_recorded_476.wav	This cottage was given to me yesterday by a little Goat with blue hair.
task_1_level_4_recorded_477.wav	And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability.
task_1_level_4_recorded_478.wav	If it is true, she sighed, that you find in me a friend, let us turn back together.
task_1_level_4_recorded_479.wav	Scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion.
task_1_level_4_recorded_480.wav	I had read all the papers and all the books in the library, but for the sake of something to do I went to the bookcases and shoved them open with my elbow.
task_1_level_4_recorded_481.wav	He turned back into the room.
task_1_level_4_recorded_482.wav	She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.
task_1_level_4_recorded_483.wav	It is so perfect out here, and I must go in to my maid.
task_1_level_4_recorded_484.wav	I thought, for a Catholic priest.
task_1_level_4_recorded_485.wav	Even in his blindness, he was the stronger.
task_1_level_4_recorded_486.wav	The car shook and the windows rattled.
task_1_level_4_recorded_487.wav	Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely.
task_1_level_4_recorded_488.wav	But I ought to have gone before.
task_1_level_4_recorded_489.wav	A pretty girl gave him a glance from a pair of violet eyes.
task_1_level_4_recorded_490.wav	I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.
task_1_level_4_recorded_491.wav	He is an excellent young man, both as son and brother.
task_1_level_4_recorded_492.wav	Would you like one for your buttonhole?
task_1_level_4_recorded_493.wav	Seemed to have a restless brain.
task_1_level_4_recorded_494.wav	I waited for what the girl had to say.
task_1_level_4_recorded_495.wav	He came four times a day for a week.
task_1_level_4_recorded_496.wav	The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass.
task_1_level_4_recorded_497.wav	A kind look shone in his eyes.
task_1_level_4_recorded_498.wav	I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well.
task_1_level_4_recorded_499.wav	And I longed very much to kill a Morlock or so.
task_1_level_4_recorded_500.wav	Then the Time Traveller put forth his finger towards the lever.
task_1_level_4_recorded_501.wav	But he was not satisfied with this.
task_1_level_4_recorded_502.wav	She wore white, transparent, simple there were coral beads about her firm young throat.
task_1_level_4_recorded_503.wav	Soft little hands, too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.
task_1_level_4_recorded_504.wav	She slurred over the word dangerous but I picked it up.
task_1_level_4_recorded_505.wav	one can think of nothing else.
task_1_level_4_recorded_506.wav	And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.
task_1_level_4_recorded_507.wav	But that was nothing once, there, I was over twelve hundred in.
task_1_level_4_recorded_508.wav	He may be asleep now, and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats?
task_1_level_4_recorded_509.wav	So he threw back his long hair and frowned at the crowd.
task_1_level_4_recorded_510.wav	Not so far out, Valentine, take care!
task_1_level_4_recorded_511.wav	Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.
task_1_level_4_recorded_512.wav	Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back again, and she began below.
task_1_level_4_recorded_513.wav	I drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect.
task_1_level_4_recorded_514.wav	But to go to school I need a suit of clothes.
task_1_level_4_recorded_515.wav	That quiet, level voice was awakening doubts as to his view of the situation, the first he had had since the moment of turning and walking down the Shenstone village church three years ago.
task_1_level_4_recorded_516.wav	It only, in truth, left my friend still more grave.
task_1_level_4_recorded_517.wav	He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
task_1_level_4_recorded_518.wav	She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
task_1_level_4_recorded_519.wav	But halfway to the bell his resolution wavered, disappeared.
task_1_level_4_recorded_520.wav	I went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning.
task_1_level_4_recorded_521.wav	He began to speak again, touching her caressingly at times by way of emphasis.
task_1_level_4_recorded_522.wav	I only told him I thought we had better not be seen very often together in the streets.
task_1_level_4_recorded_523.wav	I heard the bells in the city ring ten, eleven, and midnight.
task_1_level_4_recorded_524.wav	We broke our fast, speaking of ourselves.
task_1_level_4_recorded_525.wav	It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
task_1_level_4_recorded_526.wav	But see, he looks up and is not afraid.
task_1_level_4_recorded_527.wav	She wanted the artist soul of him to realise it.
task_1_level_4_recorded_528.wav	This hay is not bad, he said to himself.
task_1_level_4_recorded_529.wav	I shall go and say we are sorry.
task_1_level_4_recorded_530.wav	bleated the little Goat on the high rock.
task_1_level_4_recorded_531.wav	It had only one row of windows above the ground floor.
task_1_level_4_recorded_532.wav	And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
task_1_level_4_recorded_533.wav	She, called upon to yield and give, has her mind turned at once upon herself.
task_1_level_4_recorded_534.wav	but he only grinned, dusting the chalk from my black cloak.
task_1_level_4_recorded_535.wav	But there were the two somber figures still following him, though their black sacks were drenched and dripping with water.
task_1_level_4_recorded_536.wav	How soon shall we be quite alone?
task_1_level_4_recorded_537.wav	he repeated, with interrogative amazement in his voice.
task_1_level_4_recorded_538.wav	Everything in this world may be of some use!
task_1_level_4_recorded_539.wav	Within it sat either a Fox, a Hawk, or a Vulture.
task_1_level_4_recorded_540.wav	I am afraid it will give her a shock.
task_1_level_4_recorded_541.wav	She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
task_1_level_4_recorded_542.wav	And she was no nymph, but only a goatherd girl.
task_1_level_4_recorded_543.wav	No.  But it might have been an assassin that pulled the bell ready to kill a poor harmless woman.
task_1_level_4_recorded_544.wav	For not alluding to your leaving us?
task_1_level_4_recorded_545.wav	The Further Vision   I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling.
task_1_level_4_recorded_546.wav	A table laid out for four occupied very little space.
task_1_level_4_recorded_547.wav	But she distinctly uttered the word fear.
task_1_level_4_recorded_548.wav	Then he rose to his feet and looked across once more to the stone lion and the broad coping.
task_1_level_4_recorded_549.wav	It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been.
task_1_level_4_recorded_550.wav	To do that I had actually to raise her chin with my finger, and it sank slowly down again.
task_1_level_4_recorded_551.wav	The centre window, immediately over the communion table, represented the Saviour of the world, dying upon the cross.
task_1_level_4_recorded_552.wav	Go home, you yelping little beast!
task_1_level_4_recorded_553.wav	You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.
task_1_level_4_recorded_554.wav	A squeal from one of the falcons interrupted her, and she arose to adjust the longe which had become whipped about the bloc, but the bird still flapped its wings and screamed.
task_1_level_4_recorded_555.wav	You will have to be my wife.
task_1_level_4_recorded_556.wav	To his poor little innocent mates!
task_1_level_4_recorded_557.wav	This, then, is my revenge, that you do me the courtesy of accepting food and shelter at my own house.
task_1_level_4_recorded_558.wav	I suppose you got him out of the house about five minutes after you heard I was coming here.
task_1_level_4_recorded_559.wav	You see, I come into my money next year.
task_1_level_4_recorded_560.wav	I lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing.
task_1_level_4_recorded_561.wav	He looked up and saw two tall Carabineers near him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_562.wav	What a dreadful turn, to be sure, miss!
task_1_level_4_recorded_563.wav	Having had one glimpse of her as The Wife, his mind had leaped on, and seen her as The Mother.
task_1_level_4_recorded_564.wav	exclaimed the doctor, almost surprised into another slip.
task_1_level_4_recorded_565.wav	His body, not counting the tail, is almost a mile long.
task_1_level_4_recorded_566.wav	The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye.
task_1_level_4_recorded_567.wav	That is more to the point.
task_1_level_4_recorded_568.wav	I, being alone and idle, stared abstractedly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_569.wav	Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough, particularly as uttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off intonations as if he were tossing roses.
task_1_level_4_recorded_570.wav	I no longer asked for any one.
task_1_level_4_recorded_571.wav	It was the third day of the month he had often consulted her as to expenses before this.
task_1_level_4_recorded_572.wav	No, I had no plans against him.
task_1_level_4_recorded_573.wav	I am a little to blame.
task_1_level_4_recorded_574.wav	In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine.
task_1_level_4_recorded_575.wav	There was a challenge in the reposeful black eyes resting upon my face.
task_1_level_4_recorded_576.wav	Then in that warm and scented infinity, or eternity, in which I rested lost in bliss but ready for any catastrophe, I heard the distant, hardly audible, and fit to strike terror into the heart, ringing of a bell.
task_1_level_4_recorded_577.wav	We are tired of hearing you bragging about yourself, you little turkey cock!
task_1_level_4_recorded_578.wav	I wanted to make sure at once.
task_1_level_4_recorded_579.wav	Those eyebrows alone ought to have been enough to give her away.
task_1_level_4_recorded_580.wav	I recognized the rights of his passion which I could very well see.
task_1_level_4_recorded_581.wav	How I had overlooked him during my search for the cat, I cannot imagine.
task_1_level_4_recorded_582.wav	A knock at the door interrupted him, and his face resumed its amiable expression.
task_1_level_4_recorded_583.wav	But as he was about to give it the first blow, he stood still with arm uplifted, for he had heard a wee, little voice say in a beseeching tone Please be careful!
task_1_level_4_recorded_584.wav	The Phantom of the Past would go no further.
task_1_level_4_recorded_585.wav	Instantly he brought reassurance to her.
task_1_level_4_recorded_586.wav	And I obedient, he said, bowing low over her hand.
task_1_level_4_recorded_587.wav	She crossed the street with a hole in her stocking.
task_1_level_4_recorded_588.wav	She stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them.
task_1_level_4_recorded_589.wav	He felt restless and anything but sleepy, and glanced irresolutely at the library door, and at the stairway.
task_1_level_4_recorded_590.wav	She was happy, she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy.
task_1_level_4_recorded_591.wav	My poor wife will be quite distracted.
task_1_level_4_recorded_592.wav	It was the last evening of Carnival.
task_1_level_4_recorded_593.wav	Good boys always tell the truth.
task_1_level_4_recorded_594.wav	It was always touch and go.
task_1_level_4_recorded_595.wav	But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
task_1_level_4_recorded_596.wav	She rocked, with a benignly triumphant expression, and a complacent rustle of silken skirts.
task_1_level_4_recorded_597.wav	Then we can go on and be at the seashore in the morning.
task_1_level_4_recorded_598.wav	And do you know that you are missing the curate?
task_1_level_4_recorded_599.wav	Not my heart, she said quietly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_600.wav	I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark.
task_1_level_4_recorded_601.wav	These buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him, and I cannot speak their language.
task_1_level_4_recorded_602.wav	Very good, said the young seal carelessly.
task_1_level_4_recorded_603.wav	She was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw it all.
task_1_level_4_recorded_604.wav	Well, I thought perhaps I had better get out.
task_1_level_4_recorded_605.wav	The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up worse.
task_1_level_4_recorded_606.wav	Then I shall be free, Brand, when you are.
task_1_level_4_recorded_607.wav	If it were only a big enough cloud I might try to run away in the darkness.
task_1_level_4_recorded_608.wav	Yes they said you would like it better.
task_1_level_4_recorded_609.wav	Brand, I am often so tried by the sense of an unseen human presence near me.
task_1_level_4_recorded_610.wav	he muttered, and lighting a candle, went into the bedroom.
task_1_level_4_recorded_611.wav	Tuesday passed uneventfully, to all outward seeming.
