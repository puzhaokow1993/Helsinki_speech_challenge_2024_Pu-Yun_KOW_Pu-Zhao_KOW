task_1_level_1_recorded_001.wav	I thought I should have fainted.
task_1_level_1_recorded_002.wav	After a while, I picked up the gun, and turning my back on the sun tramped on again.
task_1_level_1_recorded_003.wav	Here is his answer, if you like to see it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_004.wav	But in the end she did go.
task_1_level_1_recorded_005.wav	Do you remember how the Israelites were shut in, between Migdol and the sea?
task_1_level_1_recorded_006.wav	What did you do it for?
task_1_level_1_recorded_007.wav	At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
task_1_level_1_recorded_008.wav	said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth.
task_1_level_1_recorded_009.wav	Before she finished I began to paint, and she resumed the pose, smiling and chattering like a sparrow.
task_1_level_1_recorded_010.wav	Is he too so very remarkable?
task_1_level_1_recorded_011.wav	I have not, said the Provincial Mayor.
task_1_level_1_recorded_012.wav	I even composed a most beautiful letter of farewell.
task_1_level_1_recorded_013.wav	Away in front the crackling had become one prolonged crash.
task_1_level_1_recorded_014.wav	I wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air.
task_1_level_1_recorded_015.wav	People in the shops are very polite and people in the world are like people in the shops.
task_1_level_1_recorded_016.wav	I want you to worry less, and to buy yourself some new gowns, and to begin to enjoy life!
task_1_level_1_recorded_017.wav	Not actually, perhaps, at this moment.
task_1_level_1_recorded_018.wav	I put on the screws now and then, he explained.
task_1_level_1_recorded_019.wav	I felt that the cause was mine and that I should surely get all.
task_1_level_1_recorded_020.wav	Thank you for your kind explanation!
task_1_level_1_recorded_021.wav	That donkey was worried about something, but I have spoken to him and now he seems quiet and reasonable.
task_1_level_1_recorded_022.wav	To myself, she repeated in a loud tone.
task_1_level_1_recorded_023.wav	No, I mean not out of this room, I said with some embarrassment.
task_1_level_1_recorded_024.wav	The Wolves are a free people, said Father Wolf.
task_1_level_1_recorded_025.wav	I woke with a start to her voice saying positively  No.  Not even in this room.
task_1_level_1_recorded_026.wav	What do I do, with the mirror?
task_1_level_1_recorded_027.wav	There is an agent of ours, a fellow I have been employing for purchasing supplies, a perfectly honest man.
task_1_level_1_recorded_028.wav	Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
task_1_level_1_recorded_029.wav	But you are going to be a sorry boy before very long.
task_1_level_1_recorded_030.wav	You have not heard all that you ought to hear.
task_1_level_1_recorded_031.wav	That can have only one meaning.
task_1_level_1_recorded_032.wav	The story was so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober.
task_1_level_1_recorded_033.wav	He said it was something like genius.
task_1_level_1_recorded_034.wav	And now you have gone over to the enemy.
task_1_level_1_recorded_035.wav	A woman is always an interesting subject and I was thoroughly awake to that interest.
task_1_level_1_recorded_036.wav	By Jove, a fellow wants to have a clean bill when he shakes hands with her!
task_1_level_1_recorded_037.wav	He might as well have spoken to the wind.
task_1_level_1_recorded_038.wav	But, darling, in those dark days which are past, all seemed gone, for us both.
task_1_level_1_recorded_039.wav	At times I could wring her neck.
task_1_level_1_recorded_040.wav	I need not risk the scaffold, since now you are safe.
task_1_level_1_recorded_041.wav	Anxiety moved her to question him.
task_1_level_1_recorded_042.wav	This whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire.
task_1_level_1_recorded_043.wav	I said, Why tell me of the world?
task_1_level_1_recorded_044.wav	That odor tickled my hunger and I followed it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_045.wav	Almost every sentence she spoke, drew attention to it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_046.wav	He has, for the second time, quite altered.
task_1_level_1_recorded_047.wav	I had always my hypocrisy of work, behind which, now, I gained the sofa.
task_1_level_1_recorded_048.wav	He would eliminate me somehow out of the affair.
task_1_level_1_recorded_049.wav	He was always agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.
task_1_level_1_recorded_050.wav	It is being young, he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
task_1_level_1_recorded_051.wav	I hoped for a forgotten hairpin, for some tiny piece of ribbon.
task_1_level_1_recorded_052.wav	It was like being in an enchanted place.
task_1_level_1_recorded_053.wav	Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty.
task_1_level_1_recorded_054.wav	She is a most unfortunate creature.
task_1_level_1_recorded_055.wav	The tempest of emotion in her arms was hushed to rest.
task_1_level_1_recorded_056.wav	Near the park gates a little knot of excited boys were preparing to fly a kite.
task_1_level_1_recorded_057.wav	She speculated, as she gathered in her tricks.
task_1_level_1_recorded_058.wav	At that moment I attained the knowledge of who it was I had before me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_059.wav	he cried, turning around this is a queer place for you!
task_1_level_1_recorded_060.wav	I could find no machinery, no appliances of any kind.
task_1_level_1_recorded_061.wav	We have no engagement for Thursday?
task_1_level_1_recorded_062.wav	I was feeling quite inanimate as to body and frightfully stimulated as to mind all the time.
task_1_level_1_recorded_063.wav	And he wiped away a tear.
task_1_level_1_recorded_064.wav	No reason to disbelieve my son!
task_1_level_1_recorded_065.wav	It was a mere emotional trick.
task_1_level_1_recorded_066.wav	His face was toward me now, and with a perfectly involuntary movement I bent to see it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_067.wav	They faced each other for a moment.
task_1_level_1_recorded_068.wav	To the bridge which few may pass came young and old.
task_1_level_1_recorded_069.wav	There was but one sane inference someone had taken a liberty rather gross.
task_1_level_1_recorded_070.wav	What of the quarry ye went to kill?
task_1_level_1_recorded_071.wav	cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
task_1_level_1_recorded_072.wav	But no place could be too sacred for that which we have to say to each other, and the Holy Presence, in which we both believe, is here to bless and ratify it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_073.wav	He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door.
task_1_level_1_recorded_074.wav	But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?
task_1_level_1_recorded_075.wav	No I have friends near by.
task_1_level_1_recorded_076.wav	There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.
task_1_level_1_recorded_077.wav	What do you mean by speaking like this, in this tone, in these words?
task_1_level_1_recorded_078.wav	And it was true to say I was going, for was I not going into darkness?
task_1_level_1_recorded_079.wav	The great thing now is to help the patient to take an interest in the outer world.
task_1_level_1_recorded_080.wav	We shall only ask the people we like!
task_1_level_1_recorded_081.wav	Everyone was silent for a minute.
task_1_level_1_recorded_082.wav	And with one leap, he perched himself there.
task_1_level_1_recorded_083.wav	Are you posing, or are you executing a song and dance, my friend?
task_1_level_1_recorded_084.wav	There were only two other doors in the hall, right and left.
task_1_level_1_recorded_085.wav	But shots pierced the retina of each eye, and the sight is hopelessly gone.
task_1_level_1_recorded_086.wav	Perhaps even now she is yearning to be here.
task_1_level_1_recorded_087.wav	And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
task_1_level_1_recorded_088.wav	A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.
task_1_level_1_recorded_089.wav	What has it got to do between you and me who are the only two beings in the world that may safely say that we have no need of shams between ourselves?
task_1_level_1_recorded_090.wav	He could not bear to hear any of them read even the royal letter remained unopened, though he asked to have it in his hand, and fingered the tiny crimson crown.
task_1_level_1_recorded_091.wav	I came here only to take a very few grapes.
task_1_level_1_recorded_092.wav	shouted his master just then, as he came into the stable.
task_1_level_1_recorded_093.wav	You had it from himself, had you?
task_1_level_1_recorded_094.wav	And I enjoy thinking of the colours, too.
task_1_level_1_recorded_095.wav	I belong to a musical band in my village and I need a drum.
task_1_level_1_recorded_096.wav	Beautiful work, was there some of it finished some, incomplete.
task_1_level_1_recorded_097.wav	It is only natural, I suppose but it is fallen nature and therefore to be surmounted.
task_1_level_1_recorded_098.wav	I wish you to know that I never have been a donkey, nor have I ever pulled a wagon.
task_1_level_1_recorded_099.wav	And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present moment.
task_1_level_1_recorded_100.wav	The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist.
task_1_level_1_recorded_101.wav	You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment.
task_1_level_1_recorded_102.wav	Instead of the agitation I had feared, I found myself able to paint there tranquilly.
task_1_level_1_recorded_103.wav	The girl hesitated, glanced toward the shore.
task_1_level_1_recorded_104.wav	And withal I was absolutely afraid to go!
task_1_level_1_recorded_105.wav	Look at that fat man in blue!
task_1_level_1_recorded_106.wav	I came home to talk it over with you.
task_1_level_1_recorded_107.wav	Farewell and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly than their brickbats.
task_1_level_1_recorded_108.wav	Then there is the future, said the Very Young Man.
task_1_level_1_recorded_109.wav	And of furious loves, too, no doubt, she caught him up in a mocking voice.
task_1_level_1_recorded_110.wav	His answer was puzzling I shall probably want to live.
task_1_level_1_recorded_111.wav	He bent over her, smoothing the curly hair on her forehead.
task_1_level_1_recorded_112.wav	The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly.
task_1_level_1_recorded_113.wav	Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was not necessary to me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_114.wav	This consciousness of universal loss had this advantage that it induced something resembling a state of philosophic indifference.
task_1_level_1_recorded_115.wav	Retreating backward, down the court, I faced him.
task_1_level_1_recorded_116.wav	Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
task_1_level_1_recorded_117.wav	It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
task_1_level_1_recorded_118.wav	What do you mean by more time?
task_1_level_1_recorded_119.wav	It positively is not right for any one to be so absolutely flawlessly lovely.
task_1_level_1_recorded_120.wav	You forget the place is growing half suburban.
task_1_level_1_recorded_121.wav	He would shut her up in a convent for a time if he could.
task_1_level_1_recorded_122.wav	That was too much, and he turned on his heel and entered his hotel.
task_1_level_1_recorded_123.wav	I should not have used the expression.
task_1_level_1_recorded_124.wav	He looked from her about him, as if for a shelter for her emotion.
task_1_level_1_recorded_125.wav	But I am afraid the air will sound rather poor without the accompaniment.
task_1_level_1_recorded_126.wav	Come to the foot of the hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee and we will come into the croplands to play with thee by night.
task_1_level_1_recorded_127.wav	Certainly, he replied, with ready courtesy.
task_1_level_1_recorded_128.wav	I know nothing of the process.
task_1_level_1_recorded_129.wav	He could have done so with a slight effort, but it would have been too much trouble.
task_1_level_1_recorded_130.wav	I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless and uncomfortable.
task_1_level_1_recorded_131.wav	His whole life is one thought of me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_132.wav	It seemed to touch the edges of the plain.
task_1_level_1_recorded_133.wav	It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I cannot believe it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_134.wav	I might have been an acquaintance of the day before yesterday.
task_1_level_1_recorded_135.wav	I suppose my love was too great for madness to get hold of me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_136.wav	It was a sharp trap for the inscrutable!
task_1_level_1_recorded_137.wav	Then the Marionette took off his clothes and laid them on the sand to dry.
task_1_level_1_recorded_138.wav	How long does it take from here to the shore?
task_1_level_1_recorded_139.wav	He came in full of smiling playfulness.
task_1_level_1_recorded_140.wav	He was to try the new organ at eleven.
task_1_level_1_recorded_141.wav	Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
task_1_level_1_recorded_142.wav	But spare my poor old father.
task_1_level_1_recorded_143.wav	If I were your grandmother I should send you in to take them off.
task_1_level_1_recorded_144.wav	The creature rose and crept toward the saucer.
task_1_level_1_recorded_145.wav	Where can you find a place that will agree better with you and me?
task_1_level_1_recorded_146.wav	In half an hour she would be back here in her room again, with all the past clean and straight at last, with the cloud gone, and with her whole soul singing with hope of the glorious future.
task_1_level_1_recorded_147.wav	Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
task_1_level_1_recorded_148.wav	The words in which she would tell him came to her in a rush.
task_1_level_1_recorded_149.wav	Certain streets have an atmosphere of their own, a sort of universal fame and the particular affection of their citizens.
task_1_level_1_recorded_150.wav	He raised her gently, put his arms about her, and stood there, glorified by his great love.
task_1_level_1_recorded_151.wav	And oh, do believe that I know something of how hard it is for you.
task_1_level_1_recorded_152.wav	Are you going to lie down?
task_1_level_1_recorded_153.wav	She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself.
task_1_level_1_recorded_154.wav	She looked at her gloves critically.
task_1_level_1_recorded_155.wav	Most of it will sound like lying.
task_1_level_1_recorded_156.wav	for the love of beauty, you know.
task_1_level_1_recorded_157.wav	He had nestled down his head most conveniently.
task_1_level_1_recorded_158.wav	However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again.
task_1_level_1_recorded_159.wav	Up till then he had not shown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else.
task_1_level_1_recorded_160.wav	Look at these two sitting up!
task_1_level_1_recorded_161.wav	And eventually, I continued more quietly, it will secure the happiness of the whole world.
task_1_level_1_recorded_162.wav	The butler could do a little bass, which is to say that, while the other parts soared to higher regions, he could stay on the bottom note if carefully placed there, and told to remain.
task_1_level_1_recorded_163.wav	Then for a time they were mute, acknowledging by silence the happiness of being together.
task_1_level_1_recorded_164.wav	she digressed in a tone of great humility.
task_1_level_1_recorded_165.wav	And he barked as if he were a real watchdog Bow, wow, wow!
task_1_level_1_recorded_166.wav	You will go away because you feel you must.
task_1_level_1_recorded_167.wav	And if the Fairy scolds me?
task_1_level_1_recorded_168.wav	He can now claim protection, if he will only remember the words, from all in the jungle.
task_1_level_1_recorded_169.wav	She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
task_1_level_1_recorded_170.wav	I have no doubt of it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_171.wav	At last he thought he had reached a safe place.
task_1_level_1_recorded_172.wav	There was something incongruous in that peace.
task_1_level_1_recorded_173.wav	For the general wisdom of mankind will always stop short on the limit of the formidable.
task_1_level_1_recorded_174.wav	She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
task_1_level_1_recorded_175.wav	I said it was for the service of the King.
task_1_level_1_recorded_176.wav	He did not omit to do so.
task_1_level_1_recorded_177.wav	It tells me of meadows and clear rivers.
task_1_level_1_recorded_178.wav	You march across this lawn like a grenadier.
task_1_level_1_recorded_179.wav	Well, tell me what you think of me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_180.wav	In another moment the pale stars alone were visible.
task_1_level_1_recorded_181.wav	And I put it to him with most naive indiscretion which did not shock him visibly.
task_1_level_1_recorded_182.wav	For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil.
task_1_level_1_recorded_183.wav	A petal had fallen upon the tiny wrist.
task_1_level_1_recorded_184.wav	I see better at night than by day.
task_1_level_1_recorded_185.wav	No, she had had enough of interference.
task_1_level_1_recorded_186.wav	Whichever monsieur pleases, he replied, with an angelic smile.
task_1_level_1_recorded_187.wav	I waited for him to pull out a crucifix and sentence me to the stake there and then.
task_1_level_1_recorded_188.wav	It lay there prostrate, handless, without its head, pathetic, like the mangled victim of a crime.
task_1_level_1_recorded_189.wav	There is something I want to ask you.
task_1_level_1_recorded_190.wav	But my mind was already in revolution my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment.
task_1_level_1_recorded_191.wav	There was exquisite homage in the dropped, listening head, the eyes that smiled so close to her own.
task_1_level_1_recorded_192.wav	But where did I come into the dream?
task_1_level_1_recorded_193.wav	Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
task_1_level_1_recorded_194.wav	It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.
task_1_level_1_recorded_195.wav	I must have given a nervous start.
task_1_level_1_recorded_196.wav	She is the only woman that ever wrote to me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_197.wav	You are a mere child at it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_198.wav	he said, rubbing his mutilated ears.
task_1_level_1_recorded_199.wav	She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
task_1_level_1_recorded_200.wav	I am almost frightened when I think what I have found.
task_1_level_1_recorded_201.wav	You look as though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.
task_1_level_1_recorded_202.wav	Then the wound was not serious?
task_1_level_1_recorded_203.wav	Her son was very far from being the first of the name.
task_1_level_1_recorded_204.wav	There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor economical struggle.
task_1_level_1_recorded_205.wav	So that the morning brought courage.
task_1_level_1_recorded_206.wav	I see you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names.
task_1_level_1_recorded_207.wav	Soon after I had had enough and came home.
task_1_level_1_recorded_208.wav	What with entertainments and parties, the hours, the days, the weeks passed like lightning.
task_1_level_1_recorded_209.wav	I have just indicated to you what it would mean to me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_210.wav	You ought to be proud of yourself.
task_1_level_1_recorded_211.wav	He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
task_1_level_1_recorded_212.wav	I went over and put my arm about her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_213.wav	Plenty of girls find it out then!
task_1_level_1_recorded_214.wav	In the evening the Marionette studied by lamplight.
task_1_level_1_recorded_215.wav	Go on her way to what?
task_1_level_1_recorded_216.wav	For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path.
task_1_level_1_recorded_217.wav	And I thought that would be the end of it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_218.wav	Now show us how gracefully you can jump through the rings.
task_1_level_1_recorded_219.wav	Then he went over to the rosebush and touched the blossoms with his face.
task_1_level_1_recorded_220.wav	Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of falling.
task_1_level_1_recorded_221.wav	I feel as if I could not live without her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_222.wav	He is not going, she said hoarsely.
task_1_level_1_recorded_223.wav	He put down his glass and opened the window.
task_1_level_1_recorded_224.wav	Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain these things to him!
task_1_level_1_recorded_225.wav	Just then a large Pigeon flew far above him.
task_1_level_1_recorded_226.wav	A horror of this great darkness came on me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_227.wav	She slipped on a Japanese robe and walked to the window.
task_1_level_1_recorded_228.wav	We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands.
task_1_level_1_recorded_229.wav	The intimacy of this sort of attendance helped the growth of my authority.
task_1_level_1_recorded_230.wav	Perhaps a little more at the mercy of contradictory impulses than other women.
task_1_level_1_recorded_231.wav	This was how he now lay, and he did not turn as they entered.
task_1_level_1_recorded_232.wav	I ought to have done so on the instant.
task_1_level_1_recorded_233.wav	He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
task_1_level_1_recorded_234.wav	I was only convinced that I soon would be.
task_1_level_1_recorded_235.wav	I am always so awfully afraid of there being a FLY in things.
task_1_level_1_recorded_236.wav	The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints.
task_1_level_1_recorded_237.wav	You must be the best judge of your own happiness.
task_1_level_1_recorded_238.wav	With some pipe ash amongst a little spilt wine his forefinger traced a capital R.
task_1_level_1_recorded_239.wav	But it would not do he had not come to the point.
task_1_level_1_recorded_240.wav	Dear friend, if you ever pray for me, pray that I may never be so base as to offer to any woman such a husk as marriage with me would mean.
task_1_level_1_recorded_241.wav	He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood.
task_1_level_1_recorded_242.wav	It would have been unworthy of us both.
task_1_level_1_recorded_243.wav	he would simply rejoice in his heart.
task_1_level_1_recorded_244.wav	She herself would be its sole inspiration.
task_1_level_1_recorded_245.wav	I, of course, could have no such pretensions.
task_1_level_1_recorded_246.wav	She sent me the pages in question before she died.
task_1_level_1_recorded_247.wav	I must have had some piece of luck come to me either in love or at cards, she bantered.
task_1_level_1_recorded_248.wav	My view now was that he was aware beforehand of the subject of the conversation, and if so I did not wish to appear as if I had slunk away from him after the interview.
task_1_level_1_recorded_249.wav	What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.
task_1_level_1_recorded_250.wav	I saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_251.wav	If you turn the heads of old dowagers such as I am, what chance have all these chickens?...
task_1_level_1_recorded_252.wav	I was not, said the girl.
task_1_level_1_recorded_253.wav	In the meantime, the night became darker and darker.
task_1_level_1_recorded_254.wav	A snap too much and the bulls will charge.
task_1_level_1_recorded_255.wav	It will be felt so great an attention!
task_1_level_1_recorded_256.wav	Positively I thought he would begin to slobber.
task_1_level_1_recorded_257.wav	Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
task_1_level_1_recorded_258.wav	Why should I talk of another woman?
task_1_level_1_recorded_259.wav	I knew who it came from.
task_1_level_1_recorded_260.wav	I saw him often with his parents at Sunday mass.
task_1_level_1_recorded_261.wav	If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_262.wav	But he drew himself up when I approached him and actually took off his hat to me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_263.wav	What do you think about it?
task_1_level_1_recorded_264.wav	If to be fair is to be beautiful, he said, who can compare with me in my white mask?
task_1_level_1_recorded_265.wav	With a lesson more or less, we are always the same donkeys.
task_1_level_1_recorded_266.wav	Her heart was sick within her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_267.wav	Is she all he thinks her?
task_1_level_1_recorded_268.wav	It was really clever of her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_269.wav	After that, he threw them into a large, empty tub.
task_1_level_1_recorded_270.wav	There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped.
task_1_level_1_recorded_271.wav	There is only one word which I loathe more than I do lunatic and that word is crazy.
task_1_level_1_recorded_272.wav	That sort of thing, to have any value should be spontaneous.
task_1_level_1_recorded_273.wav	A clock in the distant village struck midnight.
task_1_level_1_recorded_274.wav	They are certain to have canaries.
task_1_level_1_recorded_275.wav	I stood up and looked round me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_276.wav	Trouble is sure to come to you!
task_1_level_1_recorded_277.wav	I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day.
task_1_level_1_recorded_278.wav	But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
task_1_level_1_recorded_279.wav	Well, I think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.
task_1_level_1_recorded_280.wav	She allowed him to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening her lips.
task_1_level_1_recorded_281.wav	After a while it went out, but I did not stir.
task_1_level_1_recorded_282.wav	He is extremely fond of mowing the lawns, and my maid tells me he is studying French with her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_283.wav	Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry.
task_1_level_1_recorded_284.wav	I snapped back at him that I had no door, that I was a nomad.
task_1_level_1_recorded_285.wav	He is not Mang the Bat, to hang in the branches.
task_1_level_1_recorded_286.wav	She laughed faintly, Half a minute would be nearer.
task_1_level_1_recorded_287.wav	This room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory.
task_1_level_1_recorded_288.wav	In the old days once out of my riding habit I would never dress.
task_1_level_1_recorded_289.wav	He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_290.wav	She had counted on his being petty.
task_1_level_1_recorded_291.wav	But I doubt if he heard me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_292.wav	I think he was meaning to be kind.
task_1_level_1_recorded_293.wav	Changing tints of orange and crimson played over the surface, and then what seemed to be a ray of pure sunlight struck through from the bottom where the lily was resting.
task_1_level_1_recorded_294.wav	The whole house seemed to shake.
task_1_level_1_recorded_295.wav	Now and again he disappeared only to reappear once more.
task_1_level_1_recorded_296.wav	There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
task_1_level_1_recorded_297.wav	I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world.
task_1_level_1_recorded_298.wav	The jungle is shut to me and the village gates are shut.
task_1_level_1_recorded_299.wav	About the middle of the month.
task_1_level_1_recorded_300.wav	She raised her head with a quick gesture.
task_1_level_1_recorded_301.wav	I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere.
task_1_level_1_recorded_302.wav	She told me that she liked to hear people of that sort spoken of in terms of our common humanity.
task_1_level_1_recorded_303.wav	But if I were as wise as all that I should never be here.
task_1_level_1_recorded_304.wav	It was a tighter place still than I had yet turned round in all the more that, for the first time, I could see in the aspect of others a confused reflection of the crisis.
task_1_level_1_recorded_305.wav	An old man was lying among the tumbled sheets.
task_1_level_1_recorded_306.wav	She laughed in contralto a penetrating sound with something generous in it not infectious, but in others provoking a smile.
task_1_level_1_recorded_307.wav	This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.
task_1_level_1_recorded_308.wav	I came in for several reasons.
task_1_level_1_recorded_309.wav	I always take the part of my own sex.
task_1_level_1_recorded_310.wav	But that day she looked sort of colourless.
task_1_level_1_recorded_311.wav	he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his life.
task_1_level_1_recorded_312.wav	He took his tone from her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_313.wav	There is nothing between you and the piano and you are facing towards it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_314.wav	He says I am different from any girl he ever knew.
task_1_level_1_recorded_315.wav	Thou hast done harm enough for one night.
task_1_level_1_recorded_316.wav	I imagine that if my daughter had known this, she might have been spared some suffering and some humiliation.
task_1_level_1_recorded_317.wav	She is safe to get the worst of it at the time, but it has a restraining effect afterwards.
task_1_level_1_recorded_318.wav	He is very fond of it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_319.wav	Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_320.wav	And he could not fight this, just because it was partly true.
task_1_level_1_recorded_321.wav	No, they were not in mine!
task_1_level_1_recorded_322.wav	The boy may lose his way.
task_1_level_1_recorded_323.wav	the girl echoed, in a dream.
task_1_level_1_recorded_324.wav	Everyone worked, everyone had something to do.
task_1_level_1_recorded_325.wav	The Psychologist seemed about to speak to me, but changed his mind.
task_1_level_1_recorded_326.wav	She realised what a tremendous conflict was in progress in that quiet room.
task_1_level_1_recorded_327.wav	I could do very well without it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_328.wav	This done I recrossed the room with measured steps, with downcast eyes, and approaching the couch without raising them from the carpet I sank down on my knees and leaned my forehead on its edge.
task_1_level_1_recorded_329.wav	I know you are attached to them.
task_1_level_1_recorded_330.wav	Ah, then you look into the court.
task_1_level_1_recorded_331.wav	He was terrifying, but he was not serious.
task_1_level_1_recorded_332.wav	Let us stop a few minutes at that pigeon coop down there.
task_1_level_1_recorded_333.wav	no I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information I obtained.
task_1_level_1_recorded_334.wav	The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
task_1_level_1_recorded_335.wav	he said, after looking at them and smelling them with pleasure.
task_1_level_1_recorded_336.wav	I regretted I was not a poet.
task_1_level_1_recorded_337.wav	But I had overlooked one little thing.
task_1_level_1_recorded_338.wav	There was an enchanting vitality about her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_339.wav	He did, however, speak of the safe as a biscuit box.
task_1_level_1_recorded_340.wav	I am ashamed to meet all these people.
task_1_level_1_recorded_341.wav	I might have slept there, and the whole thing have been a dream.
task_1_level_1_recorded_342.wav	And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!
task_1_level_1_recorded_343.wav	I refuse to leave this spot, answered the Cricket, until I have told you a great truth.
task_1_level_1_recorded_344.wav	That is the nearest yet, she murmured.
task_1_level_1_recorded_345.wav	The cat, too, was asleep, her cheek turned up upon her wasted flank, her paws relaxed and limp.
task_1_level_1_recorded_346.wav	How am I to tell you?
task_1_level_1_recorded_347.wav	The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
task_1_level_1_recorded_348.wav	Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.
task_1_level_1_recorded_349.wav	No, no your room is full enough.
task_1_level_1_recorded_350.wav	He had not yet reached the studio.
task_1_level_1_recorded_351.wav	I admit we move freely in two dimensions.
task_1_level_1_recorded_352.wav	She read his telegram through once more, and smiled.
task_1_level_1_recorded_353.wav	She had herself been first with him for many years past.
task_1_level_1_recorded_354.wav	I did not see you before.
task_1_level_1_recorded_355.wav	That was last winter, she said, the very day I had the first horrid dream about the hearse.
task_1_level_1_recorded_356.wav	You are quite right, he said.
task_1_level_1_recorded_357.wav	Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
task_1_level_1_recorded_358.wav	When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised.
task_1_level_1_recorded_359.wav	She wore the same wrapper of thick blue silk.
task_1_level_1_recorded_360.wav	The maid brought him coffee and rolls.
task_1_level_1_recorded_361.wav	We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.
task_1_level_1_recorded_362.wav	No, to be sure you could not but I never thought of that before.
task_1_level_1_recorded_363.wav	It had already lasted a minute, and it lasted while I continued, seizing my colleague, quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my pointing hand.
task_1_level_1_recorded_364.wav	Let me tell it to you.
task_1_level_1_recorded_365.wav	That will be just the proper thing.
task_1_level_1_recorded_366.wav	Also, here is one little white lever, and here is another.
task_1_level_1_recorded_367.wav	Afterwards he tells a lie and, in punishment, his nose grows longer and longer.
task_1_level_1_recorded_368.wav	He left me not half an hour ago.
task_1_level_1_recorded_369.wav	But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.
task_1_level_1_recorded_370.wav	Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you.
task_1_level_1_recorded_371.wav	She did not move, and he repeated I must go.
task_1_level_1_recorded_372.wav	Nevertheless, the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque.
task_1_level_1_recorded_373.wav	She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
task_1_level_1_recorded_374.wav	We thank you for your attention!
task_1_level_1_recorded_375.wav	But I am a partial old friend.
task_1_level_1_recorded_376.wav	What has a man to do with us?
task_1_level_1_recorded_377.wav	The shock of the cannon sickened him.
task_1_level_1_recorded_378.wav	He had not time to enter into much explanation.
task_1_level_1_recorded_379.wav	That old priest absolutely pushed the parcel away.
task_1_level_1_recorded_380.wav	Wild roses clustered in the hedges.
task_1_level_1_recorded_381.wav	Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!
task_1_level_1_recorded_382.wav	Finally, not finding anything else in the manger, he tasted the hay.
task_1_level_1_recorded_383.wav	What have you done with your coat and your hat and your breeches?
task_1_level_1_recorded_384.wav	I was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people.
task_1_level_1_recorded_385.wav	And if I am myself, you mean?
task_1_level_1_recorded_386.wav	You are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones.
task_1_level_1_recorded_387.wav	The tie between us is broken.
task_1_level_1_recorded_388.wav	No, he learned to mumble a few words when he lived for three years with a band of trained dogs.
task_1_level_1_recorded_389.wav	But she lifted the veil, and I passed in.
task_1_level_1_recorded_390.wav	Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_391.wav	What did she know of the world?
task_1_level_1_recorded_392.wav	Doctor, he said, tell me about this nurse.
task_1_level_1_recorded_393.wav	There was nothing in this at all alarming.
task_1_level_1_recorded_394.wav	He carried a yellow rose in his hand.
task_1_level_1_recorded_395.wav	The same evening I took the keys and went into the house I had known so well.
task_1_level_1_recorded_396.wav	Do you really travel through time?
task_1_level_1_recorded_397.wav	The view I had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.
task_1_level_1_recorded_398.wav	She paused, her lips tight pressed.
task_1_level_1_recorded_399.wav	I killed him to teach him a lesson.
task_1_level_1_recorded_400.wav	In changing my jacket I found…  The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table.
task_1_level_1_recorded_401.wav	So she waited silently, and as she waited the silence grew and seemed to enclose her within cruel, relentless walls which opened only to allow her glimpses into the vista of future lonely years.
task_1_level_1_recorded_402.wav	But I am sure he got something out of her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_403.wav	I have heaps to say to you which cannot be shouted to the whole front of the house.
task_1_level_1_recorded_404.wav	So she followed meekly into the pretty room prepared for her admired the chintz answered questions about her night journey admitted that she would be very glad of breakfast, but still more of a bath if convenient.
task_1_level_1_recorded_405.wav	At the words, the door opened and a dapper little old man came in.
task_1_level_1_recorded_406.wav	I like enthusiasm in every branch of art.
task_1_level_1_recorded_407.wav	The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across.
task_1_level_1_recorded_408.wav	It was settled that they should go to Box Hill.
task_1_level_1_recorded_409.wav	At first he fascinated me with his fatal aspect and his cold society smiles.
task_1_level_1_recorded_410.wav	Now kiss me here then here.
task_1_level_1_recorded_411.wav	That is the case with us all, papa.
task_1_level_1_recorded_412.wav	He did not mean to harm her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_413.wav	It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_414.wav	I believe she would have cast herself into it had I not restrained her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_415.wav	He says he smiled at the romantic notion.
task_1_level_1_recorded_416.wav	The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other.
task_1_level_1_recorded_417.wav	I came very close to telling my mother, just now.
task_1_level_1_recorded_418.wav	This was one of her expressions.
task_1_level_1_recorded_419.wav	But you do, he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
task_1_level_1_recorded_420.wav	Until today I have worked for my father.
task_1_level_1_recorded_421.wav	A poor lone girl amongst a lot of wicked people.
task_1_level_1_recorded_422.wav	Elephants are very strictly preserved by the Indian Government.
task_1_level_1_recorded_423.wav	Upon my honour, said he very seriously, it does not.
task_1_level_1_recorded_424.wav	Then taking her by the arm I led her towards the door.
task_1_level_1_recorded_425.wav	You see I have not yet broken my fast because I wished you to eat with me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_426.wav	It took two years to make, retorted the Time Traveller.
task_1_level_1_recorded_427.wav	The cat ceased snarling and presently began a loud purring which seemed to increase in timbre as he stroked her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_428.wav	He took off his peaked cap as she mounted the carpeted stairs.
task_1_level_1_recorded_429.wav	At the same moment he raised his head and looked at me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_430.wav	A moment before I had been hot and faint with sheer boredom.
task_1_level_1_recorded_431.wav	He had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of and that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom.
task_1_level_1_recorded_432.wav	She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there.
task_1_level_1_recorded_433.wav	She raised her eyes and looked out into the world from the window.
task_1_level_1_recorded_434.wav	The man stared, and ran back up the one street of the village shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in white, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead.
task_1_level_1_recorded_435.wav	Neither had they the impervious skins which seem the rule in the fine world that wants only to get on.
task_1_level_1_recorded_436.wav	The Editor stood up with a sigh.
task_1_level_1_recorded_437.wav	I felt absolutely calm and responsible.
task_1_level_1_recorded_438.wav	I daresay, but what of that?
task_1_level_1_recorded_439.wav	She was conscious of her discontent it was new to her to be conscious of it.
task_1_level_1_recorded_440.wav	How did you come by this?
task_1_level_1_recorded_441.wav	I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
task_1_level_1_recorded_442.wav	She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
task_1_level_1_recorded_443.wav	She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
task_1_level_1_recorded_444.wav	What are we to do with him?
task_1_level_1_recorded_445.wav	And now you must be wanting a brush up and breakfast, and here am I selfishly keeping you from both.
task_1_level_1_recorded_446.wav	Cannot you now see your mistake?
task_1_level_1_recorded_447.wav	He felt himself fainting, his eyes filled with tears, and he wept bitterly.
task_1_level_1_recorded_448.wav	A charming, clever, rich and altogether uncommon woman.
task_1_level_1_recorded_449.wav	There were my things in the apartment on the first floor.
task_1_level_1_recorded_450.wav	He was building a little boat with which to cross the ocean.
task_1_level_1_recorded_451.wav	And I observed coldly  I really know your son so very little.
task_1_level_1_recorded_452.wav	What had become of your perspicacity?
task_1_level_1_recorded_453.wav	Why, it was to show you I could!
task_1_level_1_recorded_454.wav	She accepted this with a smile.
task_1_level_1_recorded_455.wav	The horrible part was the waiting.
task_1_level_1_recorded_456.wav	She is given over to worldly, carnal thoughts.
task_1_level_1_recorded_457.wav	A large party secures its own amusement.
task_1_level_1_recorded_458.wav	She listened while his footsteps died away.
task_1_level_1_recorded_459.wav	We copied it from the Elegant Extracts.
task_1_level_1_recorded_460.wav	He has robbed you of your purse!
task_1_level_1_recorded_461.wav	You will find some friends here.
task_1_level_1_recorded_462.wav	But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change.
task_1_level_1_recorded_463.wav	All the boyishness in me was aroused.
task_1_level_1_recorded_464.wav	And now her brother has managed it for her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_465.wav	He turns and off he goes, and no one will ever be the wiser.
task_1_level_1_recorded_466.wav	But I have experimental verification, said the Time Traveller.
task_1_level_1_recorded_467.wav	It has been funnier than usual.
task_1_level_1_recorded_468.wav	No, no, said she, you are quite unreasonable.
task_1_level_1_recorded_469.wav	That lady, the strange lady, spoke to you of your sister first!
task_1_level_1_recorded_470.wav	He has only seen her once, and does not know her name.
task_1_level_1_recorded_471.wav	I am glad you think so and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.
task_1_level_1_recorded_472.wav	He looked at her hand again, looked up at her as if he would speak.
task_1_level_1_recorded_473.wav	The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.
task_1_level_1_recorded_474.wav	His hunger finally appeased, he raised his head to thank his kind benefactress.
task_1_level_1_recorded_475.wav	He found out I was innocent when I caught the Weasels and he let me go.
task_1_level_1_recorded_476.wav	I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love.
task_1_level_1_recorded_477.wav	He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand.
task_1_level_1_recorded_478.wav	It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.
task_1_level_1_recorded_479.wav	But it terrifies me to find how my mental pictures are fading all but one.
task_1_level_1_recorded_480.wav	We are waiting for them, was the reply.
task_1_level_1_recorded_481.wav	Good woman, will you allow me to have a drink from one of your jugs?
task_1_level_1_recorded_482.wav	You are right, little Cricket, you are more than right, and I shall remember the lesson you have taught me.
task_1_level_1_recorded_483.wav	The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host.
task_1_level_1_recorded_484.wav	As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory.
task_1_level_1_recorded_485.wav	High on the rock stood a little Goat bleating and calling and beckoning to the Marionette to come to her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_486.wav	There shall be no war between any of us in the Pack.
task_1_level_1_recorded_487.wav	You never loved him, you know.
task_1_level_1_recorded_488.wav	I had gone dumb, I could only stare at her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_489.wav	What gets you up so early?
task_1_level_1_recorded_490.wav	Men were fighting all around him now, and the air was foul with smoke and sweat.
task_1_level_1_recorded_491.wav	It struck her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world.
task_1_level_1_recorded_492.wav	The curtains were drawn, but there appeared still to be a light behind them.
task_1_level_1_recorded_493.wav	He was on the move immediately but coming back, said,  I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_494.wav	It seemed that they vanished among the bushes.
task_1_level_1_recorded_495.wav	The best thing to do is to leave them in peace!
task_1_level_1_recorded_496.wav	Presently he arose, and jamming his hat on his head, marched to the door.
task_1_level_1_recorded_497.wav	I do not care for myself.
task_1_level_1_recorded_498.wav	But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more.
task_1_level_1_recorded_499.wav	She smiled and smiled, and we met but it was all done in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous.
task_1_level_1_recorded_500.wav	A magnificent Poodle appeared, walking on his hind legs just like a man.
task_1_level_1_recorded_501.wav	Good boys go gladly to school.
task_1_level_1_recorded_502.wav	She could not control her mirth.
task_1_level_1_recorded_503.wav	I have looked into the inmost recesses of a very rare and beautiful nature, and I have seen what havoc a woman can work in the life of the man who loves her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_504.wav	Absolutely, replied the doctor in a tone of quiet conviction.
task_1_level_1_recorded_505.wav	They simply express their regret that it should be impossible to keep him.
task_1_level_1_recorded_506.wav	Yes, I will help her, said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
task_1_level_1_recorded_507.wav	We can never make friends with her or thank her.
task_1_level_1_recorded_508.wav	And now whatever we say to each other at night or in daylight, that sentiment must be taken for granted.
task_1_level_1_recorded_509.wav	The time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history, in any way.
task_1_level_1_recorded_510.wav	You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
