# Brief description of algorithms 

This is an audio deconvolution program, which is specially designed for the [Helsinki Speech Challenge 2024](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/helsinki-speech-challenge/). In the spirit of open science, we also provide the codes which we used to train the models. 

**Tasks T1L1, T1L2, T1L3** 
> We first transform both clean and polluted data using [fast fourier transformc (FFT)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/fft.html). Consequently, we train the magnitude of the transformed data, and we **do not** train the phase. We multiply the trained magnitude and the original phase, and the inverse FFT outputs the denoised data. 

**Tasks T1L4, T1L5, T1L6, T1L7, T2L1, T2L2, T2L3** 
> We basically use the same ideas as above, but now we also train the phase. The problem is tricky, since the phase has period 2Ï€. In order to overcome this difficulty, we [unwrap](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.unwrap.html) the phase of both clean and polluted data and handle them by using [PolynomialFeatures in scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). We multiply the trained magnitude and the trained (and wrapped) phase, and the inverse FFT outputs the denoised data.

# Installation instructions, including any requirements 

In the spirit of open science, we include all the program in this resipotory, except for the trained model due to its large size. In order to distribute the trained model, we will also compressed all necessary files into zip files in order to simplify the installation and the usesage of the program. 
- Python 3.9 is required for the main program `main.py`; but 
- Python 3.8 is required for the model training program (including `data_preprocessing.py`) with requirements in `training_requirement.txt` and the testing program `evaluate.py` with requirements in `preprocessing_evaluate_requirement.txt`. 

> [!WARNING]
> It is strongly recommended to open different enviromnent to prevent the incompability of python packages. 

- [ ] Pu-Zhao comments: make sure the program can be run by just unzip the zip file. 

# Usage instructions 

- [ ] Pu-Zhao comments: TBA 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The programs only handle 16-bit 16kHz audio files, in `.wav` format.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The name of the directories/folders must not be changed. 

# An illustration of some example results 

- [ ] Pu-Zhao comments: TBA (put some audio files for demonstration, and also show the mean CER)

> [!NOTE]
> Here the mean characater error rate (CER) are evaluated using `evaluate.py` provided by the organizer. We do not use it to train our model according to the [rules](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/helsinki-speech-challenge/rules/).
